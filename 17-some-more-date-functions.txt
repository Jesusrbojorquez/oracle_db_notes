Some More Date Functions
I'd like to introduce you to 2 more functions. You should practice and memorize these.
LAST_DAY(d)
last_day is a date function that requires a date as an argument. It returns the last day of the month in which the given date falls. The argument is required for this function to work properly.



NEXT_DAY(d, c)
The first argument is the date and the second argument is a text reference to a day of the week. Both arguments are required for this function to work properly. This function returns a valid date representing the first occurrence of the c day following the date represented in d.
